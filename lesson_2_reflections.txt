What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder appears, to store what changes will be made.
A commit isn't made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is more like a flagging system for what will be committed.
It's useful because it means not everything needs to be committed. It also means you have to specifically tell git what you want to upload. It's a layer of protection from accidentally overwriting something.
